# Module-11-Repo
 For this challenge, we were tasked with creating an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This app needed to use Express.js in the back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s was already created for us in the Starter Code. It's my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku.
